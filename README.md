**depot** is my personal monorepo of my tools, services and configuration.

Its **has moved** [git.tazj.in][]. At this point most of my software (unless it
lives in other organisations) is no longer developed on GitHub.

You probably want to look at the new [about page][https://git.tazj.in/about/].

If you are looking for an issue tracker, issues and patches for my projects are
tracked at [depot@tazj.in][] (which is also the email address that you can send
issues and patches to).
